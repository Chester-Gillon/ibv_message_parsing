The following is the output from the counters following a run of the ibv_functional_loopback_test program:

The counts of the following make sense based upon the test of data being transmitted from port 1 and received on port 2:
with flow control in the opposite direction:
- IB_PC_EXT_XMT_BYTES_F (transmit 32-bit words)
- IB_PC_EXT_RCV_BYTES_F (receive 32-bit words)
- IB_PC_EXT_XMT_PKTS_F (transmit packets)
- IB_PC_EXT_RCV_PKTS_F (receive packets)

While the names IB_PC_EXT_XMT_BYTES_F and IB_PC_EXT_RCV_BYTES_F suggest they count bytes, https://community.mellanox.com/docs/DOC-1320 says:
"XmtData: The total number of data octets, divided by 4, transmitted on all VLs from the port.
 RcvData: The total number of data octets, divided by 4, received on all VLs from the port."
 
Based upon the change in values for IB_PC_EXT_XMT_BYTES_F and IB_PC_EXT_RCV_BYTES_F during the ibv_functional_loopback_test they
are counting 32-bit words and not bytes.

The following are not displayed, since the "Performance Management ClassPortInfo:CapabilityMask"
reports they are not supported on the Mellanox ConnectX-2:
- IB_PC_EXT_XMT_UPKTS_F (transmit unicast packets)
- IB_PC_EXT_RCV_UPKTS_F (receive unicast packets)
- IB_PC_EXT_XMT_MPKTS_F (transmit multicast packets)
- IB_PC_EXT_RCV_PKTS_F (receive multicast packets)

IB_PC_XMT_WAIT_F being a small value is to be expected according to https://www.openfabrics.org/mediawiki/index.php/Overview_of_Error_Counters
and means some packets had to wait before being tranmitted.


When the cable was pulled out got symbol errors IB_PC_ERR_SYM_F (which looks to be a 16 bit count)
and one line downed IB_PC_LINK_DOWNED_F count which makes sense:

Once the cable was reconnected, and opensm reported that the links were back up, the IB_PC_ERR_SYM_F count has been zeroed.
IB_PC_LINK_DOWNED_F remained at one.
