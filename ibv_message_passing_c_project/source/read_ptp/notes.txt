By default /dev/ptp0 was only accessable by root, so had to give read/write permission with:
$ sudo chmod o+rw /dev/ptp0

phc_open opened the PTP device with flags O_RDWR

Results of running after update time of 9 hours 52 minutes, which had not attempted to synchronise the PTP clock:

The seconds value for CLOCK_MONOTONIC matches the uptime.

The seconds value for the PTP clock is approx 19 seconds ahead of CLOCK_REALTIME.
Not sure if a different start time, or difference in clock frequency.

When debugging found that:
a) clock_gettime (CLOCK_REALTIME) and clock_gettime (CLOCK_MONOTONIC) didn't result in a syscall
b) clock_gettime for the ptp0 clock ID results in syscall (__NR_clock_gettime)
