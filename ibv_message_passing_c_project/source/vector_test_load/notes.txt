Test workstation
================

These tests were run in a HP Z640 with two "Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 v3 @ 2.40GHz" processors.
The OS was Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with Kernel 4.4.0-134-generic.
The Intel pstate driver was used for runtime power management (the default).


Tests with runtime power management and turbo mode enabled in the BIOS
======================================================================

I.e. the processors allow for opertunistic frequency boost.

One processor was used to run AVX threads, and other SSE threads.

The turbostat program was used to measure the processor power consumption with the above workloads:

Tests with runtime power management and turbo mode disabled in the BIOS and capped power limits
===============================================================================================

Each processor has an upper power limit of 85W, and indicated by the intel-rapl default status after boot.
$ cat /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:[0-1]/constraint_0_power_limit_uw
85000000
85000000

To cause the test work-load to run into the processor power limit, with runtime power management disabled set a limit of 37.5W:
$ echo 37500000 | sudo tee /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:[0-1]/constraint_0_power_limit_uw
37500000
$ cat /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl:[0-1]/constraint_0_power_limit_uw
37500000
37500000

And with the maximum power reduced the measured CPU frequencies with the workloads were:
