time_sync_measurements.zip contains the CSV file of test results.
The master was a dual CPU E5-2620 v3 @ 2.40GHz haswell system.
The slave was a single i5-2310 CPU @ 2.90GHz.

The PCs were connected with a 1G Ethernet connection to a switch.
A dual QDR port Mellanox connectX-2 was in each PC, with direct connections between the PCs for measuring the
synchronised time offset.


time_not_synched.csv
====================

Before PTP had been started on the master and slave. This shows a 34.79 second offset when time was not synchronised.


time_sync_starts.csv
====================

The PTP synchronisation was started on the master and slave during this test.

Before the time had synchronised there was a 34.79 second offset.
After the time had synchronised the time offset measured with a 2-3us round trip delay was 5347 to 7506 ns.

The master is using CLOCK_REALTIME to measure the round-trip delay. On the measurement interval in which time synchronisation
occurred the number of samples was 37 times the others. This suggests CLOCK_REALTIME on the master can jump at the point
phc2sys is started.

When the master and slave PCs had booted there was an approx one second difference, and the time on the master was manually
changed to introduce an offset of around 35 seconds which presuambly adjusted CLOCK_REALTIME but not PTP time.
On a normal boot not sure how much offset there is between CLOCK_REALTIME and PTP time, but shows the master should really be
using CLOCK_MONOTONIC to measure the round-trip delay.


time_sync_started.csv
=====================

The PTP synchronisation had already been started on the master and slave before this test.

The time offset measured with a 2-3us round trip delay was 5603 to 7983 ns.


time_sync_started_blast_master_to_slave.csv
===========================================

Before this test was started:
- The PTM synchronisation had already been started on the master and slave.
- tcpBlaster sending 116750256 bytes/sec from master to slave.

The time offset measured with a 2-3us round trip delay was -6832 to -4869 ns.


time_sync_started_blast_master_bidir_slave.csv
==============================================

Before this test was started:
- The PTM synchronisation had already been started on the master and slave.
- tcpBlaster sending 93124595 bytes/sec from master to slave.
- tcpBlaster sending 92123768 bytes/sec from slave to master.

The time offset measured with a 2-3us round trip delay was -14058 to 13827 ns.
